  Dumbledore's Army (D.A.) is the secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group founded by Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, with assistance from Ron Weasley.

  Professor Dolores Umbridge, Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry's fifth year, only lectures on Ministry-approved theory from the textbook, and refuses either to teach real defensive magic, or to allow practicing defensive spells. Within the first two weeks of classes, Hermione has seen how stultifying and useless this form of teaching is, and with the assistance of Ron, suggests to Harry that it would be a good idea to have someone teach the students real Defence Against the Dark Arts, rather than the useless "conciliation techniques" currently being taught only through books. When Harry agrees to this, Hermione tentatively suggests that the appropriate teacher would be Harry himself. Harry is surprised when Ron agrees that he is the logical choice.

  Although Harry initially feels he is unqualified to teach Defensive Arts to any interested classmates, he reluctantly agrees after Hermione and Ron convince him he has gained considerable knowledge on the subject through their experiences in the past four years. Hermione then invites "a couple of students" to meet at the Hog's Head Inn on their next Hogsmeade weekend to discuss forming a group to learn real Defence Against the Dark Arts. Harry is stunned when Hermione's "couple of students" ends up numbering 25; Hermione simply says "The idea did seem quite popular." The group struggles briefly with a name for themselves, eventually suggesting the nebulous name Defence Association, or D.A. for short.
